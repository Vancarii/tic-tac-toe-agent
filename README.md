# Tic-Tac-Toe Agent

This repository contains the implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe Agent. The agent uses a combination of search algorithms and strategy-based rules to play optimal games against a human or another agent.

## Project Requirements

1. **Implement and test the following search algorithms:**
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
   - Greedy Best-First Search
   - A* Search

## Assignment Instructions

2. **Write Python code for a Tic-Tac-Toe agent:**
   - The agent should make optimal moves by minimizing the opponent's chances of winning while maximizing its own.

3. **Implement heuristic functions:**
   - Define and apply heuristic functions to improve the performance of Greedy Best-First and A* searches.

4. **Analyze the performance of each search algorithm:**
   - Compare the algorithms in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and optimality in different Tic-Tac-Toe scenarios.

5. **Demonstrate the search algorithms with visualizations:**
   - Illustrate how each algorithm explores the Tic-Tac-Toe board and makes decisions.
